                <p>
                    The city of Rexburg was founded in March 1883 when an intrepid group of pioneers decided to settle
                    along
                    the banks of the Teton River. They had been sent by church leaders in Salt Lake City, under the
                    direction of Thomas E. Ricks, to settle the Upper Snake River Valley.</p>
                <p>
                    The new community, named Rexburg
                    after their leader (Ricks being German for Rex or King) quickly attracted men and women eager to
                    bring
                    industry and civilization to the West. By the time Idaho entered the Union as the 43rd state in
                    1890,
                    Rexburg was the second largest city in the state.

                    As part of the History of the town we need to mention the Teton Dam Flood. Located in the eastern
                    part
                    of the state, between Fremont and Madison counties, the Teton Dam suffered a catastrophic failure on
                    June 5, 1976, as it was filling for the first time.</p>
                <p>
                    The collapse of the dam resulted in the deaths of eleven people and 16,000 livestock.The dam cost
                    about $100 million to build and the federal government paid over $300 million in claims related to
                    its
                    failure. Total damage estimates have ranged up to $2 billion. The dam has not been rebuilt.

                <p>The Rexburg Idaho Temple was the third temple built in Idaho, following the Idaho Falls Idaho Temple

                <p>The announcement of the Rexburg Idaho Temple came three and a half years after the announcement that
